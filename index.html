                <h2 style="color: rgb(161, 133, 9);"> Best Nikon Cameras for Landscape Phototgraphy</h2>
                <p>
                    What is the best Nikon camera for photographing landscapes? The answer isn’t so simple. After all, a
                    good camera for
                    daytime landscape photography may not be the right choice for something like Milky Way photography.
                    But if you’re
                    interested in photographing landscapes and want to understand Nikon’s options, this guide should
                    help!

                    I’ve personally used nearly all of Nikon’s DSLR and Z mirrorless cameras, past and present, during
                    the course of writing
                    reviews at Photography Life. What I’ve found is that every single modern Nikon camera can be used to
                    take high-quality
                    landscape photos, without exception. Still, some are better-suited to the task than others. This
                    article explains how
                    they stack up, based on my experience.

                    The rankings below are obviously subjective, but it should give you a good idea of which Nikon
                    cameras are better than
                    others for landscape photography. Note that I’ve ranked the following cameras by quality and not by
                    price, so depending
                    on your budget, some of the later cameras on the list could easily be the right choice for you.

                <h1>#1: Nikon Z9 and Z8</h1>
                </p>

                    By almost every metric, the Nikon Z8 and Nikon Z9 are Nikon’s best, most advanced cameras yet. Even
                    though both are
                    primarily geared toward sports and wildlife photographers, they also have Nikon’s most advanced
                    features for landscape
                    photography. I ranked them as tied for first place because they have essentially the same features
                    as one another –
                    especially where landscapes are concerned – but have different form factors.

                    Alongside the 45-megapixel sensor and base ISO of 64, the Nikon Z8 and Z9 have some features found
                    on few, if any, other
                    Nikon cameras. These include amazing astrophotography features like illuminated buttons, “starlight
                    view” autofocus, and
                    a dim red-light mode for the rear LCD. There’s also a dual-axis tilting LCD and a sensor curtain to
                    protect from dust –
                    a common issue for landscape photographers shooting at f/11 or f/16.

                    The Nikon Z9 would almost be in second place in my rankings for one reason: It’s chunky. But because
                    it offers the same
                    features as the Z8 (plus a few small extras like GPS), it really depends on what form factor you
                    prefer. Some landscape
                    photographers will be happier with the extraordinary battery life on the Z9 and the bigger grip,
                    while backcountry
                    landscape photographers will prefer the lighter Z8 body. If you’re still wondering which of these
                    cameras to get, you
                    can check out our Nikon Z8 vs Nikon Z9 comparison.

                    Or, you could simply get the Z8 because it’s less expensive at $4000 vs the $5500 of the Z9. (The
                    rankings in this
                    article don’t take price into account – just pure quality for landscape photography.)

                <h1>#2: Nikon Z7II</h1>

                    Another excellent option for Nikon-based landscape photographers is the Nikon Z7 II. Like the Nikon
                    Z8 and Z9, it has a
                    45-megapixel sensor with a base ISO of 64. The Nikon Z7 II is also much lighter than the Z9,
                    weighing just 705 g / 1.55
                    lbs.

                    As much as I like the Nikon Z7 II, it could be better for landscape photography if it stole a few
                    features from the Z9.
                    For example, the Z7 II’s autofocus system usually can’t autofocus on the stars, and it doesn’t have
                    illuminated buttons
                    for Milky Way photography. Plus, the rear LCD has single-axis tilt rather than dual-axis tilt, which
                    isn’t helpful for
                    low-angle vertical photos from a tripod.

                    That said, the Z7 II is still a phenomenal camera for landscape photography. It could easily be #1
                    on this list if you
                    prefer minimal weight rather than maximal features. It’s also about $2500 less than the price of the
                    Nikon Z9. That’s a
                    lot of money to put toward good lenses (or travel).

                <h3> Conclusion</h3><hr>
                <p class="demo">
                If you’re a landscape photographer who’s looking for a Nikon camera, maybe your first takeaway from this
                article is that
                there are a million options. But I hope that your second takeaway is that you learned something useful
                for making your
                decision!

                Of course, this list is just based on my personal experiences and impressions, and the best camera
                always depends on
                your situation as a landscape photographer. Based on how your prioritize image quality, weight, and
                modern features,
                your rankings could easily shift. The same is true if one of these cameras has an unique feature that’s
                critical to your
                work. Or, maybe it could shift if you already have one of these cameras and want to justify your
                purchase :)<br><br>

                If you have any questions about these cameras or my ranking system, feel free to ask me below. As I said
                in the
                introduction, I’ve personally used almost all of these cameras, so hopefully I can help if you’re
                wondering about any of
                them. I’ll try to respond to every comment and answer your questions to the best of my ability.<br><br>
